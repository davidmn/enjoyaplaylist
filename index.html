  <h1>Enjoy a Playlist</h1>

  <p>Each week Christopher Macarthur-Boyd and Liam Withnail listen to and talk about/around one of the Rolling Stone's
    Top 500 Albums.</p>
  <p>During the course of the podcast they create a playlist of songs featured in the top 500 but also add tracks that
    have various levels of relation to the chat.</p>
  <p>This is a weird pointless resource of what tracks were added, when, and why.</p>
